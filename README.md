# GJRM-mods

This repository can reproduce results from my dissertation entitled "Two-dimensional Regression Modelling with Copula Dependencies and a Focus on Count Data and Sports Applications".
Each chapter or subchapter is represented by a single folder as follows:
- Simulation 1: Simulation study from Chapter 2.2 and publication van der Wurp et al. (2020)
- Bundesliga: Application of Chapter 2.3, unpublished before.
- Simulation 2: Simulation study from Chapter 3.2 and publication van der Wurp & Groll (2022)
- FIFA: Application of Chapter 4. Published in van der Wurp et al. (2020) and in van der Wurp & Groll (2022).
- CaseStudy: Application of Chapter 5. Published in van der Wurp & Groll (2023).

The main file with all GJRM-changes are included in "GJRM changes - 2023.R". Please note that the underlying GJRM-package is used in version 0.2-3, which needs to be installed from the archive: https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/GJRM/

If any errors occur or some files are missing (which might happen, especially with the vast amount of result files), feel free to contact me via vanderwurp@statistik.tu-dortmund.de.
